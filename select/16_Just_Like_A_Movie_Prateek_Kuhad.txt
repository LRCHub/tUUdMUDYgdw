Feels like I've been drivin' in the dark
Countin' every car, thinkin' of you
I've been walkin' circles in my room
Nowhere to move, waitin' for you
And if you could just say the word
I won't be hurt, I won't be hurt
And all I know is
You're dressed like the movies
An eighties somethin' vibe
And no one knows what you're hidin', baby
But I just think I might
With every conversation
You're pullin' at my heart
Just like a movie
The end is where we start
Start
Start
Start
Wish that I was livin' in your dream
Swimmin' in the sea of nothin' but you
If only you were thinkin' it too
Comе close to me and I'll make it truе
And if you could just say the word
We'll take the turn, we'll take the turn
But all I know is
You're dressed like the movies
An eighties somethin' vibe
And no one knows what you're hidin', baby
But I just think I might
With every conversation
You're pullin' at my heart
Just like a movie
The end is where we start
Start (Where we start)
Start (Where we start)
Start (Where we start)
The end is where we start
If you know what you want
Can you let me in your heart?
In your heart
The end is where we
You're dressed like the movies
An eighties somethin' vibe
And no one knows what you're hidin', baby
But I just think I might
With every conversation
You're pullin' at my heart
Just like a movie
The end is where we start
Start
Start
Start
The end is where we start
