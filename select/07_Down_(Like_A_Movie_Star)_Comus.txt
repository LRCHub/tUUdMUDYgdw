First she lost faith in the face of the crowd
Then she watched herself die on tv
Her features grew passé, so she held her head proud
And retired so gracefully, just in case
In case she go down, down, down like a movie star
Down, down, down; tell me who you are
Down, down, down like a shooting star
Down, down, down, but that's not the end.
What happened then was

She glanced at the guys with that glint in her eyes
Hoping to stun or catch a hint of surprise
She spent all her money on glitters and gleams
Now she's down some back alley with her bottle of dreams and it seems

That she go down, down, down like a movie star
Down, down, down; tell me who you are
Down, down, down like a shooting star
Down, down, down, she made a play
Foe the guys but they didn't look twice

The world gives no quarter to decadence daughter.
It was all too much
Like a queen of the screen from the days before sound
She was out of touch and she go down
Down, down, down, down
Down

She covered the years and the tears and the fears
With layers of make-up and mind masks
But under the smears cracks began to appear
How long can she live in the past? How long can she last
Before she go down, down, down like a movie star
Down, down, down, same old story, faded glory.
And she go down. Down, down, down, down,
Down
Down, down, down like a movie star
Down, down, down like a movie star
Down, down, down like a movie star
Down, down, down,
Oh baby you're going down, baby you're going down
Baby you're going down, baby you're going down
Down, down, down.
